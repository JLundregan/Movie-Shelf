# Movie-Shelf
A place to keep track of the movies that you own, whether physical or digital

This is an app with the sole purpose of keeping track of movies and series that you own/have permanent access to.

To add movies/series, simply go to the "Find Movies" or "Find Series" page, where you can search TMDB's database for your desired title.
You can click on each entry to bring up its information, or just add it to your shelf straight from the search page.
(Note that if you have difficulty finding a particular title, often appending "y:[release year]" will sufficiently narrow down the results).

On your shelf page, you have access to all the titles you have added and their metadata (which is occasionally prone to error), where you will be able to mark whether you have seen them or not.
Note that for series, since this app does not yet support adding individual seasons of shows, there is no functionality to indicate whether you have seen a given series 
in its entirety or only a portion.

As a final comment, while I find this utility extremely useful, this was mainly an outlet to practice my basic web dev skills, as well as get exposure to Node, Express, API calls,
Electron, etc. Feedback is appreciated, and I would be happy to address any comments you may have, but as this is mainly a practice project, I cannot promise a swift response.

Enjoy, and happy viewing!
